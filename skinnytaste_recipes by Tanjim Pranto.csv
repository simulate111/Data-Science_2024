minutes",Breakfast,"American, Mexican","These easy freezer breakfast burritos are a delicious, protein-packed way to start the day with scrambled eggs, veggies, bacon and cheese.","6 strips center cut bacon
10 large eggs, beaten
4 scallions, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.
To reheat in air fryer, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (crisp results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Unwrap and discard foil, spritz with a little oil and air fry in a preheated air fryer 400F 8 to 9 minutes, turning halfway until heated through in the center.","Air Fryer Recipes, Back To School, Breakfast and Brunch, Freezer Meals, High-Fiber Breakfast, High-Fiber Recipes, Kid Friendly, Meal Prep Recipes, Recipes, Under 30 Minutes, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes"

Gradually whisk in the chicken broth, ensuring there are no lumps.
Add the milk and increase heat to high until it comes to a boil, then add broccoli florets, Parmesan cheese, and stir well.
Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.

Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.
To reheat in air fryer, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (crisp results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Unwrap and discard foil, spritz with a little oil and air fry in a preheated air fryer 400F 8 to 9 minutes, turning halfway until heated through in the center.","Air Fryer Recipes, Back To School, Breakfast and Brunch, Freezer Meals, High-Fiber Breakfast, High-Fiber Recipes, Kid Friendly, Meal Prep Recipes, Recipes, Under 30 Minutes, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes"

¼ cup filtered water","Combine cubed chicken with salt, pepper, ginger, arrowroot, and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I like to lay it flat on a cutting board and sprinkle the oil first and mix. Then I evenly distribute the powders and seasonings and mix well to evenly combine.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

½ tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, plus more for garnish
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 tablespoon arrowroot, or cornstarch
¼ cup filtered water","Combine cubed chicken with salt, pepper, ginger, arrowroot, and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I like to lay it flat on a cutting board and sprinkle the oil first and mix. Then I evenly distribute the powders and seasonings and mix well to evenly combine.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)

¼ cup filtered water","Combine cubed chicken with salt, pepper, ginger, arrowroot, and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I like to lay it flat on a cutting board and sprinkle the oil first and mix. Then I evenly distribute the powders and seasonings and mix well to evenly combine.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.

If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

10 large eggs, beaten
4 scallions, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.
To reheat in air fryer, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (crisp results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

10 large eggs, beaten
4 scallions, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up.

Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

1/2 red bell pepper, diced

12 tablespoons shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese
6 8-inch flour tortillas , low-carb (I used Ole Xtreme Wellness)
6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.
To reheat direct from freezer to oven: (Best results)
Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

6 pieces heavy duty foil, cut 10 x 12 inches each
hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.

Bake in a preheated oven 425F 45 minutes turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast. Let stand 2 minutes before eating.
To reheat direct from freezer to microwave (Least favorite results):  Remove the burrito from the foil and place on a microwave safe dish, cover with a paper towel microwave 1 minute. Turn then cook an additional 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes before eating. (optional, brown on a skillet 2 minutes on each side to toast, or broil 2 to 3 minutes.

2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
3/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs, or use dried oregano
2 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
black pepper, to taste","Prepare the Chicken: Start with your thin chicken cutlets. If you haven't already, follow the instructions above to pound your chicken to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Marinate the Chicken: Combine olive oil, garlic, dried herbs and vinegar in a large deep shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with salt and black pepper then add to the marinade.
Make sure they’re evenly coated then, cover and marinate at least 30 minutes, but preferably up to 2 hours for better flavor. Or as long as overnight.
Preheat Your Grill: Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with white ash.
Grill the Chicken: Once your grill is heated, oil the grates and add the chicken cutlets. Grill the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until browned and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Because the cutlets are thin, they will cook quickly. Be careful not to overcook them, as chicken can become dry if cooked too long.
Rest and Serve: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, making it more tender and flavorful.","Budget Friendly Meals, Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Father's Day, Gluten Free, Grilling Recipes, High Protein Recipes, How To Make: Simple Recipes for Beginners, July 4th, Keto Recipes, Low Carb, Meal Prep Recipes, Memorial Day, Recipes, Summer, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Whole30 Recipes"

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

hot sauce for serving, optional","Char both sides of the tortillas on a hot griddle or over the open flame. Keep warmed in the oven if eating right away. This will help the tortillas become more pliable and also improves the taste, in my opinion.
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).
To reheat, thawed overnight in the refrigerator: (Best results)
Transfer burrito to the refrigerator the night before. Bake in foil, in a preheated oven 425F 20 minutes, turning halfway. Unwrap foil and bake uncovered 5 minutes. Optional, you can also broil 2 to 3 minutes at the end to toast.

Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.
Serve the soup hot, garnished with additional cheddar cheese, if desired.","Broccoli Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Fall, Gluten Free, Kid Friendly, Lenten Friendly Recipes, Lunch, One Pot Recipes, Recipes, Soup, Vegetarian Meals, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Winter"

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

1 medium carrot, chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour, AP, whole wheat or gluten-free flour
3 cups less sodium chicken broth, or vegetable broth
1 cup fat free milk
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
fresh black pepper, to taste
6 cups broccoli florets, chopped into small pieces, about 2 heads
1-1/4 cups shredded sharp cheddar
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese","Chop onion, carrot, celery, garlic in a chopper or mini food processor.
In a large pot, melt the butter. Add the chopped vegetables, salt and pepper and sauté on low heat until soft, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the flour to create a roux, cooking for 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
Gradually whisk in the chicken broth, ensuring there are no lumps.
Add the milk and increase heat to high until it comes to a boil, then add broccoli florets, Parmesan cheese, and stir well.
Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.
Serve the soup hot, garnished with additional cheddar cheese, if desired.","Broccoli Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Fall, Gluten Free, Kid Friendly, Lenten Friendly Recipes, Lunch, One Pot Recipes, Recipes, Soup, Vegetarian Meals, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Winter"

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

3 cups less sodium chicken broth, or vegetable broth
1 cup fat free milk
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
fresh black pepper, to taste
6 cups broccoli florets, chopped into small pieces, about 2 heads
1-1/4 cups shredded sharp cheddar
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese","Chop onion, carrot, celery, garlic in a chopper or mini food processor.
In a large pot, melt the butter. Add the chopped vegetables, salt and pepper and sauté on low heat until soft, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the flour to create a roux, cooking for 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
Gradually whisk in the chicken broth, ensuring there are no lumps.
Add the milk and increase heat to high until it comes to a boil, then add broccoli florets, Parmesan cheese, and stir well.
Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.
Serve the soup hot, garnished with additional cheddar cheese, if desired.","Broccoli Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Fall, Gluten Free, Kid Friendly, Lenten Friendly Recipes, Lunch, One Pot Recipes, Recipes, Soup, Vegetarian Meals, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Winter"

In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).

1-1/4 cups shredded sharp cheddar
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese","Chop onion, carrot, celery, garlic in a chopper or mini food processor.
In a large pot, melt the butter. Add the chopped vegetables, salt and pepper and sauté on low heat until soft, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the flour to create a roux, cooking for 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
Gradually whisk in the chicken broth, ensuring there are no lumps.
Add the milk and increase heat to high until it comes to a boil, then add broccoli florets, Parmesan cheese, and stir well.
Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.
Serve the soup hot, garnished with additional cheddar cheese, if desired.","Broccoli Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Fall, Gluten Free, Kid Friendly, Lenten Friendly Recipes, Lunch, One Pot Recipes, Recipes, Soup, Vegetarian Meals, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes, Winter"

In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.

2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese","Chop onion, carrot, celery, garlic in a chopper or mini food processor.

Gradually whisk in the chicken broth, ensuring there are no lumps.
Add the milk and increase heat to high until it comes to a boil, then add broccoli florets, Parmesan cheese, and stir well.
Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.

Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.

Add the milk and increase heat to high until it comes to a boil, then add broccoli florets, Parmesan cheese, and stir well.
Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.

Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.

Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.

Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.

Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.
Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly.

In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.

In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.

Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Serve with cooked rice and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.","Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Freezer Meals, Gluten Free, High Protein Recipes, Recipes, Stir Fry Recipes, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes"

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don’t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit.

¼ cup filtered water","Combine cubed chicken with salt, pepper, ginger, arrowroot, and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I like to lay it flat on a cutting board and sprinkle the oil first and mix. Then I evenly distribute the powders and seasonings and mix well to evenly combine.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Serve with cooked rice and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.","Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Freezer Meals, Gluten Free, High Protein Recipes, Recipes, Stir Fry Recipes, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes"

In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon ginger powder
1 teaspoon arrowroot, or cornstarch
1 ½ tablespoons toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoons avocado oil, divided
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic, about 4 cloves
3 cups cooked white rice
2 scallions, sliced
1/3 cup reduced sodium soy sauce, or gluten-free tamari
3 tablespoons monk fruit sweetener, coconut sugar, honey or sweetener of choice
2 teaspoons tomato paste
2 ½ tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
½ tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, plus more for garnish
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 tablespoon arrowroot, or cornstarch
¼ cup filtered water","Combine cubed chicken with salt, pepper, ginger, arrowroot, and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I like to lay it flat on a cutting board and sprinkle the oil first and mix. Then I evenly distribute the powders and seasonings and mix well to evenly combine.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Serve with cooked rice and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.","Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Freezer Meals, Gluten Free, High Protein Recipes, Recipes, Stir Fry Recipes, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes"

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel lined plate.
In a large bowl whisk the eggs with salt. Mix in scallions and bell pepper.
Discard the bacon grease leaving 1 teaspoon then add the eggs, let them set on the bottom then stir a few times to cook through, set aside.
On a clean work surface, divide a generous 1/2 cup of the egg mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Top each a slice of bacon and 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll from the bottom, folding the left and right corners in toward the center and continue and roll into a tight cylinder.  Set aside, seam-side down, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
If eating right away, heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce or salsa, if desired.
Place the foil on a work surface vertically, place the rolled burrito in the center bottom third, roll partially, folding the sides of the foil over the burrito, then roll it up.
Transfer to a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn (you can reuse the bags).
Use a sharpie to label it with the name and date. (also helpful to write down cook time and temp).

½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon ginger powder
1 teaspoon arrowroot, or cornstarch
1 ½ tablespoons toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoons avocado oil, divided
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic, about 4 cloves
3 cups cooked white rice
2 scallions, sliced
1/3 cup reduced sodium soy sauce, or gluten-free tamari
3 tablespoons monk fruit sweetener, coconut sugar, honey or sweetener of choice
2 teaspoons tomato paste
2 ½ tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
½ tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, plus more for garnish
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 tablespoon arrowroot, or cornstarch
¼ cup filtered water","Combine cubed chicken with salt, pepper, ginger, arrowroot, and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I like to lay it flat on a cutting board and sprinkle the oil first and mix. Then I evenly distribute the powders and seasonings and mix well to evenly combine.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. When hot add half of the avocado oil and let it heat up for 1 minute.
Add half of the chicken in an even layer to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway until golden brown. It’s best to cook in batches not to overcrowd the pan so chicken can crisp up. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken and set aside.
Prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and ginger together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.
Make the slurry by combing the tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot flour and water together in a small bowl. Set aside.
Add 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to the pan along with red chili pepper flakes and garlic. Cook 30 seconds, stirring the pan frequently, until fragrant.
Add half of the sauce to the pan and continue cooking for 1 minute, stirring the bottom of the pan frequently.
Return the chicken back into the pan and toss to combine. Add the remainder of the sauce into the pan. Slowly drizzle in the arrowroot slurry and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Serve with cooked rice and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.","Chicken Breast Recipes, Chicken Recipes, Dairy Free Recipes, Dinner Ideas, Egg Free Recipes, Freezer Meals, Gluten Free, High Protein Recipes, Recipes, Stir Fry Recipes, Weight Watchers – WW Recipes"
